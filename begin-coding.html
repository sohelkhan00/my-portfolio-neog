    So you want to create your first programming blog? This is an excellent
    idea. I believe that every developer should have a blog, and I will list the
    reasons why shortly. In this article, I am going to assume that you are an
    absolute beginner who has never built a website before. I will teach you
    exactly how to build your programming blog step-by-step, starting from
    choosing a web host, registering a domain name, choosing a good blogging
    platform for developers, all the way up to how you start writing and
    promoting your articles. Without further ado, letâ€™s jump right into it.
